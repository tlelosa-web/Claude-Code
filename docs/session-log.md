# session-log.md — Claude-Code hub

One entry per hub-level session, most recent last. `/continue`'s Step 1
reads only the final entry.

## 2026-07-28 — Cross-project status survey + hub setup

Surveyed all 5 GitHub repos (`Claude-Code`, `tlelosa-claude-config`,
`NamePlateTool`, `cratetracker`, `pitwall-companion`) plus both machines
(Operations, Pappa T) for live status: open PRs, recent commits, and each
project's own `docs/todo.md`. Found zero open GitHub issues anywhere —
tracking runs entirely through `docs/todo.md` files.

Actions taken:
- Merged `tlelosa-claude-config` PR #9 (marketplace validation + plugin
  rollout completion); stopped the hourly watch-loop trigger that had been
  polling it since 2026-07-26.
- Closed this repo's PR #1 as superseded (conflicted with `main`, which
  already carries its own `CLAUDE.md`/`knowledge/` from later merged work).
- Confirmed the Pappa T ↔ cloud-environment sync bridge works end to end:
  cloned this repo on Pappa T, fetched and checked out this session's
  branch.
- Filled the TebelloReborn ("Career Engine") knowledge gap directly from a
  Pappa T session — see `knowledge/pappa-t.md`.
- Published a status dashboard as a Claude Artifact (cross-project
  priorities, machine state, resolved items).
- Set this repo up as the actual DCOE hub root per `hub-template`: added
  `.claude/commands/continue.md`, `docs/todo.md` (this queue), and this
  log; reconciled root `CLAUDE.md` against `hub-template/HUB-CHECKLIST.md`
  (CORE.md read instruction, hub-and-spoke framing, hard-rules note).

**Last completed:** Hub setup (this entry).
**Next task:** Fix the Excel-import bug in NamePlateTool — see `docs/todo.md` #1.
**Known risks:** None new. OneDrive/git corruption fix (Operations) already
holding, see `knowledge/operations-hub.md`.
**Blockers:** None.

## 2026-07-28 — Operations set up as a DCOE hub client

Ran the Operations-side setup prompt (mirrors the Pappa T setup already on
file): confirmed this repo was already cloned on the Operations work PC at
`C:\Dev\Claude-Code` (sibling of `C:\Dev\Operations`, not nested inside
it — keeps `C:\Dev\Operations` itself out of scope for its own hard rule
against becoming a git repo without a separate deliberate decision).
Confirmed clean working tree on `main`, then exercised the sync bridge for
real: `git fetch origin` + `git pull origin main` fast-forwarded 8 files
of genuinely new upstream work (this session's own prior commits — CORE.md
read instruction, `docs/todo.md`, `docs/session-log.md`,
`knowledge/pappa-t.md`, etc.), and `git push origin main --dry-run`
confirmed the push side is clean with nothing outstanding. Read root
`CLAUDE.md` and `knowledge/INDEX.md` per session-start convention. Recorded
the confirmation in `knowledge/operations-hub.md` (new dated entry) and
bumped its `INDEX.md` row.

**Last completed:** Operations DCOE hub-client setup (this entry).
**Next task:** Fix the Excel-import bug in NamePlateTool — see `docs/todo.md` #1.
**Known risks:** None new.
**Blockers:** None.
